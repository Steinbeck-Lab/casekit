MolSpec:
- [SEMI] determine hybridization via CDK (#H >= 3) and DB lookup (max. freq, TEMPORARILY)? 
- setHybridizations function: parallization?

Utils:
- write a parse function to read nmrML files
- in getHybridizations function: 
1. parallization?
2. comparing of all attached/used hydrogens with molecular formula -> helps for bond type decisions
- in getBondTypeFromHybridizations:
1. can sulfur only have 1x double bond or 2x single bond in metabolomic systems?
2. as 1. but for nitrogen and phosphorus
3. is S hybridization always single bond?
